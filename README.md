# Heltec LoRa Mapper

This project logs RSSI/SNR values from LoRa packets using a Heltec V3 board. It supports mobile signal mapping and geotagged telemetry for off-grid deployments.

## Features
- Logs signal strength (RSSI) and noise ratio (SNR)
- Optional GPS integration for geotagging
- Sample data format for mapping and analysis
- Scaffolded for future dashboard integration

## Folder Structure
- `main.ino` - Firmware logic placeholder
- `data/sample_log.csv` - Example signal log
- `docs/` - (To be added) Diagrams and deployment notes

## Goals
- Build a mobile LoRa coverage mapper
- Visualize signal strength across terrain
- Create a public GitHub artifact for technical interviews
